<!---👋 Hi, I’m @AntheaBaldacchino
👀 I’m interested in back-end development, data analysis, and working with hardware—building, fixing, and cleaning PCs.
🌱 I’m currently doing a bachelor’s degree (honours) in software development. I’m into PHP and Java, learning C, mobile development, and discrete mathematics.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can apply my knowledge in software or even hardware-related areas.
📫 Reach me where you can—I’m pretty open!
⚡ Fun fact: I love teaching myself new skills and sharing that knowledge with others. Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, philosophy, and side projects that aren’t tech-related.
